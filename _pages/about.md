This course aims to bring together computer vision and robotics. We will study different disciplines of robotic perception, including visual recogntion, multi-view reconstruction, simulation and recent topics such as in simulation, manipulation etc. We want to show how embodied agents learn to see and sense our physical environments. 

<Strong>Prerequisite knowledge</Strong>
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Probability 
- Robotic basics
- Computer vision algorithms
- Machine learning and recent deep learning approaches
- Python and PyTorch

<Strong>Course Goals</Strong>

- Understand and implement deep learning-based visual recognition and reconstruction algorithms, in the context of robotics. 
- Understand the fundamental problems in robotic perception.
- Jumpstart research in perception and robotics. 

<Strong>Grading</Strong>

- Class participation (5%)
- 1 paper presentation (15%)
- 1 course project (10% project proposal, 20% midterm report, 25% final presentation, 25% final report)
- 5 grace days in total that may be applied to the midterm report or the final report. No more than 3 grace days can be used on each.

<Strong>Collaboration</Strong>

(Adapted from Roni Rosenfeld’s Course Policies.)

- Students are encouraged to study materials in groups and are allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular homework problem. The actual solution must be done by each student alone.
- Students are expected to form a group of three to finish the course project and to evenly distribute the workload.
